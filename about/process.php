                        There are 6 Major Steps of a Aluminum Extrusion</h4>

                    <p>
                        The extrusion process is carried out in direct extrusion presses with different power levels at
                        Calibre Aluminium. To understand this process better, let's break it down into six distinct
                        steps.</p>
                    <p>
                        But even before the extrusion process begins, the aluminum rods need to be cast into smaller
                        pieces. These short pieces are called billets. The billet Size ensures that the length of each
                        extruded profile will be round about the same and there will be no material leftover.

                            The billets are heated in furnaces from room temperature to the extrusion temperature which
                            varies depending on the alloy and the final temper.
                            The heated billets need to be hot enough to take on the required shape, but still need to be
                            firm to retain their shape during the extrusion process.

                            The heated aluminum billet is forced through the openings by the stamp of the press in the

                            client requirements.
                            The process is similar to an Extruder dough toy, where the different shaped discs create
                            different dough designs.
                            After applying the pressure profiles exit the press and they are already extruded to their
                            required shape and size.

                            Immediately after cooling down, the extruded profiles are cut at a specific point.
                            The cut profiles are then caught by a puller, which lays it over the runout table, allowing
                            them to further cool down.
                            At this phase, the extruded profiles are run through a strengthening process, which
                            stretches the profiles and ensures their mechanical properties by removing the internal
                            tension within the profiles.

                Bauxite is crushed, dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water.

                This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to
                remove most of

                the silicon present in bauxites.

                <h4>REDUCTION PROCESS</h4>
                At an aluminium smelter, alumina is poured into special reduction cells with molten cryolite

                at 950⁰С. Electric currents are then induced in the mixture at 400 kA or above; this current breaks the
                bond

                between the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in liquid aluminium settling at the bottom of the
                reduction cell.

                <h4>ALUMINIUM ALLOYS</h4>
                Foundry aluminium alloys are used to make finished goods by casting the alloys into special

                moulds. The required properties are given to the metal by adding various admixtures such as silicon,
                copper or

                magnesium. These alloys are used in the manufacture of automobile and aviation engines and aluminium
                alloy

                wheels.

                <h4>RECYCLING</h4>
                Unlike iron, aluminium is corrosion resistant so it can be remelted and reused an infinite number of

                times. The added benefit is that recycling aluminium requires only 5% of the energy needed to make the
                same

                amount of primary aluminium.
