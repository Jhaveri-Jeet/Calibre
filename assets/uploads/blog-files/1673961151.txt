Powered by an algorithm, it combines an off-the-shelf glucose monitor and insulin pump with an app.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">The burden of diabetes is continuously on the rise across the world and India is no different. Estimates have shown that there were 77 million individuals diagnosed with diabetes in India in 2019. This is expected to rise to over 134 million by 2045. The newly developed system could aid countries like India in fighting the diabetic burden.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">Researchers from the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge have developed an artificial pancreas that helps maintain healthy glucose levels. The app known as CamAPS HX is run by an algorithm that predicts how much insulin is required to maintain glucose levels in the target range.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/health/story/what-is-vitiligo-the-skin-condition-malayalam-actress-mamta-is-diagnosed-with-2322625-2023-01-17" title="What is vitiligo?

The artificial pancreas can provide a safe and effective approach to help them, and the technology is simple to use and can be implemented safely at home,” Dr. Charlotte Boughton, who co-led the study, said in a statement.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">The study published in the journal Nature Medicine details the first trial of the device in a wider population living with type 2 diabetes. 26 patients were chosen for the trial and were randomly allocated to one of two groups – the first group would trial the artificial pancreas for eight weeks and then switch to the standard therapy of multiple daily insulin injections; the second group would take this control therapy first and then switch to the artificial pancreas after eight weeks.</p>
