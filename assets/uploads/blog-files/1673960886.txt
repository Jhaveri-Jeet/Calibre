Both the applications were rejected by the sessions court by way of common order in November 2019.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">Post this, the investigation in the case was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the trial was transferred to the Special NIA court.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">The application was listed before a single judge bench of the high court. The single judge transferred the matter before the division bench as NIA appeals have to be heard by the division bench.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">Thereafter, Sen made an application seeking to convert the bail plea into an appeal.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">However, the bench of Justices AS Gadkari and PD Naik on Tuesday noted that the Special NIA court did not have a chance to consider the bail application post the filing of the chargesheet. They directed Sen to first approach the special court so that the court could consider the supplementary chargesheet.</p><div id="teads-ad" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"></div><div id="div-gpt-ad-1663140560142-0" data-google-query-id="CJqUgIbWzvwCFbBInQkdPj0KvQ" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1007232/IT_Teads_1x1_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/1007232/IT_Teads_1x1_0" name="google_ads_iframe_/1007232/IT_Teads_1x1_0" title="3rd party ad content" width="1" height="1" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-load-complete="true" data-google-container-id="e" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; vertical-align: bottom;"></iframe></div></div><div id="div-gpt-ad-1663138917332-0" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"></div><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>ALSO READ |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/law/story/elgar-parishad-accused-jyoti-jagtap-bombay-high-court-rejects-bail-2286344-2022-10-17" target="_self" style="color: var(--linkcolor); text-decoration-line: underline;">Bombay High Court rejects bail application of Elgar Parishad case accused Jyoti Jagtap</a></strong></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">In the event the court rejects the bail plea, then the high court can take the benefit of the observations of the lower court on the chargesheet, the bench concluded on Tuesday. Accordingly, the bail application was disposed of with directions to Sen to approach the special court.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">Sen contended that she had been falsely arrested because she had exposed illegal arrests and torture. Sen's plea stated that there was deliberate and conscious omission on the part of the investigating agency to maintain the integrity of the electronic evidence allegedly seized from Sen.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>ALSO READ |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/law/story/elgar-parishad-accused-prof-anand-teltumbde-granted-bail-bombay-hc-2298732-2022-11-18" target="_self" style="color: var(--linkcolor); text-decoration-line: underline;">Elgar Parishad accused Prof Anand Teltumbde granted bail by Bombay HC</a></strong></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">Sen also claimed that the letters and communications allegedly containing incriminating material against the accused in the case were neither in her possession, nor addressed to her, or by her. "Merely because the name 'Shoma Sen' is mentioned in any of these so-called electronic letters cannot be a reasonable ground to deny bail to the applicant," the plea stated.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: var(--storyparagap); margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Rubik, helvatica, Arial, sans-serif;">She added that the contents of the letters and communications allegedly found on hard disks of the co-accused and the mere mention of the name of a lawful and registered organization such as ‘Anuradha Gandhy Memorial Committee’ cannot be sufficient ground to brand such an organization as a front organization of the proscribed CPI (Maoist).</p>
